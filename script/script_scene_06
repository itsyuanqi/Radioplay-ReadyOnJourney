[M]
We did it! 
That is not easy.

[B]
Yes! 
We succeeded; the Heart stone it’s back.

[S]
War is over!

[K]
The dark force, we defeated them!

[P]
I fulfilled my destiny to bring the heart stone back. 
My people they’re waiting for my return and to restore the kingdom.

[K]
Let us escort you back safely to the kingdom.

[N]
With the warriors' victory declared, it is proclaimed that the dark force has at last been vanquished, 
and the Heart stone has safely entrusted into the hands of Prince Sebastian. 
As the sun rises high above, they set forth on their journey back to the kingdom with no delayed 
and not forgetting their final mission. 
Yet, though this battle has won, the road ahead holds trials still untold—greater challenges and destinies yet to unfold.
