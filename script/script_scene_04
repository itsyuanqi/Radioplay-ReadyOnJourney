[P]
It was all my fault. 
I failed my destiny to bring the Heart stone back to my kingdom. 
If I had been faster, the Heart stone it wouldn’t be in the dark force hand now. 
(Desperately said by the prince)

[S]
Don’t be foolish! Get it up we are part of a team.

[K]
Yes, we will drive back and take what is supposed to be ours.

[B]
Don’t feel discouraged; 
Here, have some water get hydrated before thinking of another.

[S]
I know! Why don’t we plan for a sneak attack, but it will only be a chance. 

[M]
Thomas and I could make a feint at the front of the castle to distract the guards. 
Others could use the time to sneak into the castle and find out where has the Heart stone been hidden.

[B]
What about tonight? 
We’ll make a move before they could use the Heart stone to fulfill their evil plans.

[K]
What a great plan! 
We’ll proceed then. 
Prince Sebastian, and I will sneak in find the Heart stone and retreat safely.

[P]
Yes. Let us get refresh up before the battles.

[N]
Though the Heart stone had fallen into the dark force the heroes did not falter. 
Instead of despair, they found resolve. 
They gathered their thoughts, and from loss, a sharper plan was born. 
With great clamor the warriors armed themselves with strategy. 
Now they are prepared to strike back.
