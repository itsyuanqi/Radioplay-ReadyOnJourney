[N]
Day by day had passed since the extinguish of kingdom Elbert. 
Traveling for ages as the prince eventually sets foot into the woodland.

[P]
Hello? Anyone there.

[P]
I am here in search for the Mighty mage.

[N]
(The bush shivered)

[P]
Who! Who’s in there.

[M]
What brought you here today, Prince Sebastian?

[M]
(laugh sounds) A runaway prince.

[P]
Look. I am here to seek help from you. 
To revenge for my kingdom, I would need to borrow your power. 

[M]
Well, what would I even get in exchange for helping you. 

[P]
Anything could do regardless of my life.

[M]
There is an ancient spell which allows me to borrow mysterious power from an outer space, 
summons warriors and as well they share their ability through our blood. 
To do that it will costs me to burn out two years of my lifespan.

[M]
In exchange you will have to be my slaves for five years. How’s that?

[P]
Will do! I have no hesitation against any condition no matter what it cost me for. 
My people are still struggling; they are still waiting for me to save them.

[M]
Well then, let’s get it started.

[N]
It began with a crack in the night sky. 
Light poured through the wound in the stars.

[M]
“From stone to star, from blood to blade. 
Thou shall summon thrice, by sacred name. 
Step forth, three champions bound by fate, 
Into this circle, through arcane gate.”

[M]
Allow me to summon the mastery of blacksmith and the bravest knight.

[N]
The ground groaned two shadows of humanity fell off from the sky.

[K]
Ouch! Where am I?

[B]
What is this place, and who are you all people?

[N]
As the mage thought that the magic circle was closing leaving out one empty slot, 
feeling hesitated but then shining intensely of bright white light in the room.

[N]
Unaware of what’s going on, a tiny squirrel was sent out from the magic spell.

[S]
Where is my walnut? Giant intrusion! 

[P]
Warriors standing by here I request all your help to save my kingdom. 
A helping hand with all your powers we could fight against the dark force and search for the Heart stone.

[M]
The world is now threatened in the hand of dark force, 
the kingdom of Elbert home of Prince Sebastian was demolished by them and now, 
they aim to conquer the world with the power of Heart stone. 
It is the only artifact that could restore the balance to the fractured Kingdom. 
With the map holds by Prince Sebastian, it will lead us the way to the Broken Bell where the Heart stone were.

[N]
