[N]
The journey eventually begins 

[P]
Did you all hear something?

[P]
Look! It’s the Dark force they are here as well.

[K]
Be careful they might have seen us.

[B]
Hold your sword and be always prepared.

[S]
Brace yourself humans! 
I can sense their weakness; it is coming from the core of their chest!

[M]
The Heart stone! 
The dark force they might be on their way to it as well.

[P]
Quick! We must get there before they could find the Heart stone.

[N]
Footsteps getting heavier and quicker. 
Crossing through misty forest battling with creatures 
the warriors fought hardly on their way to the Broken Bell.

[M]
“Magic bridge!’’ 

[P]
We’re here! The Heart stone I could see it right at the end of the cave.

[P]
The dark force they are coming in this direction! 
Do not let them have it before us!

[P]
Quick! 

[K]
Get the heart stone! 
I will hold them back with my Excalibur.

[B]
Allow me to help you, Knight Felix.

[S]
Oh no run! 
The enemy backups are coming and there is too many of them.

[M]
There is no other way out now. 
We need to fallback leave the heart stone, or else we will all fall out at here.

[N]
The warriors charge into the cave — too late. 
With the benefits of troops, the dark force has taken the Heart Stone 
leaving only dusters and fading footsteps behind. 
The warriors had no choice but to fallback for a better upcoming plan.
