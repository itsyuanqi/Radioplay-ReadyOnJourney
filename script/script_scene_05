[M]
Allow me to summon skeleton army! (Magic cast sound)

[M]
From realms beyond, listen to my call! 
Through rift and root, through time and tide. 
Heed my voice and stand at my side. 
Awaken now from ageless sleep! 
Arise, arise, and never die!

[B]
Wow! You could do that?

[S]
Guys let us take over the high ground 
it will be a suitable place to check on with the enemy movements.

[N]
As the night comes, the warriors had been holding on a point 
where the enemy’s force could be clearly seen. 
Their every step driven by a single purpose was to claim back the Heart Stone.

[K]
Be careful, I’ll charge by the front. 
Prince Sebastian stays closed with me.

[P]
Thanks Felix. 
The map it will lead us the way to where the heart stone was kept.

[Everyone]
Let’s go!

[P]
We’re near, the map it has an intense sense of the stone.

[S]
I found it! 
The heart stone I could see it. 
Let me get it!

[M]
Grave news! 
The dark force they found us!

[K]
I’ll distract the guards. 
Be quick I won’t be able to hold them back for too long.

[P]
Let me help you out, Felix.

[B]
Try out my hammer! 
No one has ever survived from my attack. 
Take this!

[M]
Surround me! I’ll heal you all. (Magic casting)

[N]
Step by step, they crept through the silent corridors… 
until silence could no longer hide them. 
The guards awakened, and the once-secret mission was drowned in fire and blood.

[M]
The enemy they’re in weakness now, hurry up and attack them with a last blow.

[S]
Everyone retreats! 
I got the stone.
