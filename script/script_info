<b>Synopsis</b>
‎ 
In the deep end edge of Earth, finds the kingdom of Elbert. An ancient celestial map kept within a key that leads to the Broken Bell. Three unlikely companions a bold blacksmith’s, a retired knight, and a talking squirrel were summoned by a scholarly mage and a prince. By faith they are united to be a band of warriors to restore the balance of the fractured Kingdom. As they make through their way to the final path in search for the long-last Heart stone an artifact that holds the power of Bardo where lies ahead in the Broken bell. Meanwhile there is a group of dark forces aims to be ahead of the warriors tracking their every move wishing to conquer the world using the power of Heart stone. To defeat the dark forces each of them shares an unexplainable power coming from the outer side space allowing them to be more powerful. With a map speaking only in riddles and warnings, the group must learn to trust one another as they venture across cursed valleys, sky islands, and time-warped ruins. The voice of the map growing more cryptic with each step, they begin to wonder what the actual cost of this journey it could be. As the wind howls and the path forks, one thing is clear that they may not have been ready when they started, and there is no turning back now.

<b>概要</b>
‎ 
在地球的深渊边界，坐落着艾尔伯特王国。
一幅古老的星图被封存在一把钥匙之中，那钥匙通往破碎之钟。
三位看似不可能同行的同伴——一位勇敢的铁匠、一名退隐的骑士、以及一只会说话的松鼠——因学者法师与王子的召唤而聚集。
因信念，他们联合成一支勇士之队，誓要恢复分裂王国的平衡。
‎ 
他们踏上最终的道路，寻找那遗失已久的心之石——一件蕴含巴尔多之力的古老圣物，它正静候于破碎之钟的尽头。
与此同时，一支黑暗势力的队伍紧追其后，企图超越勇士们的脚步，妄图以心之石的力量征服世界。
‎ 
为了击败黑暗势力，每个人体内都觉醒了一股难以言喻的力量，那是来自宇宙边际的赐予，使他们更为强大。
然而，指引他们的星图只以谜语与警示言说。
他们必须学会彼此信任，方能穿越被诅咒的山谷、天空中的浮岛，以及时光扭曲的遗迹。
‎ 
随着旅途的深入，星图的声音愈发晦涩，他们开始怀疑：这段旅程的真正代价究竟是什么？
当狂风呼啸，前路分岔，有一点却已无可否认——
他们或许在启程时尚未做好准备，但如今已无法回头。
